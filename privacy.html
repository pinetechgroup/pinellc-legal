<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Pine LLC QuickBooks Integration Tool</strong></p>
<p><em>Last Updated: February 14, 2026</em></p>

<h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
<p>The Application accesses QuickBooks Online accounting data (invoices, bills, accounts, vendors, customers, and journal entries) through Intuit's official OAuth 2.0 API, solely for the purpose of bookkeeping management and data cleanup.</p>

<h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
<p>All data processing occurs locally on the user's machine. The Application does not transmit, store, or share your QuickBooks data with any external servers, third-party services, or cloud platforms. OAuth tokens are stored locally in an encrypted token file on the user's device.</p>

<h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your financial data with any third parties. Your QuickBooks data is accessed solely to perform the bookkeeping operations you authorize.</p>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security measures including OAuth 2.0 authentication, HTTPS encryption for all API communications, and local-only token storage. Access tokens are automatically refreshed and old tokens are invalidated.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>The Application does not retain copies of your QuickBooks data. All data is fetched in real-time from QuickBooks Online and is not cached or stored beyond the active session.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You may revoke the Application's access to your QuickBooks data at any time through your QuickBooks Online account settings under "Connected Apps."</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date above.</p>
